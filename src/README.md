# HTML Tag Exploration Project

This project is a university assignment designed to explore a range of HTML tags and styling methods. Some of the tags and attributes used (e.g., `<basefont>`, `<center>`, `<marquee>`, `<strike>`) are **deprecated** in modern HTML standards, but are included here to illustrate the evolution of HTML and provide historical context.

## Overview

- **Purpose**: Get familiarized with both current and outdated HTML tags.  
- **Scope**: Show how to use inline styles, internal `<style>` blocks, and external CSS files.  
- **Note**: The use of deprecated tags in **real-world applications** is discouraged. These examples are purely for educational insight.

## Project Contents

1. **HTML File** (`view.html` or similarly named):  
   - Demonstrates various tags:  
     - Semantic vs. non-semantic tags (`<strong>` vs. `<b>`, `<em>` vs. `<i>`)  
     - Outdated tags (e.g., `<marquee>`, `<center>`, `<strike>`)  
     - Basic structural elements (`<div>`, `<p>`, `<blockquote>`, etc.)  
     - Lists (`<ol>`, `<ul>`), forms (`<fieldset>`), and tables (`<table>`, `<thead>`, `<tbody>`)  
   - Includes a combination of inline, internal, and external CSS styles.

2. **CSS File** (`styles.css`):  
   - Applies global styling (background color, font family, margins, etc.)  
   - Demonstrates how to combine selectors, hover states, and float-based layouts.  

## How to Use

1. **Clone or Download** this repository.  
2. Open the `view.html` file in your favorite browser.  
   - The page will display different HTML tags, including some that are no longer recommended for use.  
3. Inspect the code:  
   - Notice how styling is applied through different methods: inline styles, internal `<style>` tags, and the external `styles.css` file.  
   - Observe the difference between semantic and non-semantic tags.  
   - See how tables, lists, and block-level elements (like `<div>`) are structured.

## Key Learning Points

- **History & Evolution**: Understand which tags are considered deprecated and why modern HTML has replaced or improved upon them.  
- **Semantic HTML**: Learn how tags like `<strong>` and `<em>` add meaning beyond just styling.  
- **Styling Approaches**: Compare the pros and cons of inline, internal, and external CSS.  
- **Layout & Structure**: Explore basic layout techniques (floating elements, margin adjustments, table usage).
